    <br><strong>Brutus</strong> is a strength-based tank hero of the Mauler faction. He deals huge damage over an area, including his normal attacks. He lowers the defenses of enemy heroes, and he has a high amount of sustain. He can be considered a tank hero because of his invulnerability skill when he is about to die. Moreover, the lower his health is, the higher the damage he has.
    <p>His ultimate ability "Whirlwind" allows him to spin into a frenzy and deal damage to his enemies. In this state, he is impervious to mind control effects.</p>
